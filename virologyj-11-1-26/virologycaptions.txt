Figure 1. Organization of the LITRV genome. A) Schematic representation of LITRV ORFs. B) LITRV coding regions and corresponding transcription regulatory sequences.       
Figure 2. Phylogeny of LITRV. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on full length L protein sequences of currently recognized species of Rhabdoviridae. Gray boxes represent ICTV-accepted species within the genus. LITRV is indicated by *. Accession numbers are provided next to the viral names. Due to excessive divergence, only the type species for Cytorhabdovirus, Novirhabdovirus and Nucleorhabdovirus are included. The Vesiculovirus piry virus is not included due to limited available sequence.
