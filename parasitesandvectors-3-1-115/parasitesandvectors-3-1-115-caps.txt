Figure 1. Geographical location of the study zones in Madagascar. (1A) presents the geographical sites where Ornithodoros soft ticks have been previously reported (dark dots with non-underlined names for sites where ticks were found before 1960 and underlined names for those where ticks were recently found). (1B), (1C) and (1D) present specific maps for the Antananarivo, Ambatondrazaka and Marovoay zones, respectively, pinpointing sites where pig sera were positive with the anti-tick ELISA test (dark squares), sites where tick examinations were conducted without finding ticks (grey triangles) and sites where ticks were found (dark crosses).       
Figure 2. Infested pig farm in Mahitsy (Madagascar). (2A) presents the building where O. porcinus ticks have been found. This building is typical from the Antananarivo zone with sand or mud soils, mud or concrete brick walls with few or no apertures except the door, and is located at the ground level of a two-storey human dwelling. (2B) presents one of the cracks inside the building where ticks were found and (2C) shows one tick (pointed by a white arrow) and many sloughed shins collected from these cracks.       
Figure 3. Phylogeny of Malagasy O. porcinus spp. ticks. This represents a rooted consensus phylogenetic tree of 16 S rDNA sequences from Malagasy O. porcinus spp. ticks collected in pig pens in 2000 and 2006-2008 (underlined names), as well as O. moubata sensu stricto, O. p. porcinus and O. p. domesticus reference sequences (bold names) and some other sequences available in GenBank for the O. moubata complex of species, using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method, with 1000 bootstraps and random sequence addition. Only bootstraps up to 50% have been indicated and identical sequences have been removed for simplification. Incorrect names given to specimens during field collection are indicated in quotes.
